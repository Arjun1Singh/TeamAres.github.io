  <content type="html">&lt;h2 id=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Gazebo is a great tool that can be used for the simulation of robots. Many people who are new to ROS , often are not able to understand Gazebo properly , and rely on pre-made robots like turtlebot , husky , etc .. 
These simulations are great! , but if you do not understand atleast the basics , then you will have a hard time figuring out how to add any modification to the robot!
If you are at this stage , then we are there to help you out!!! :smiley:
So let’s dive in!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;basic-file-structure&quot;&gt;Basic File Structure:&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are going to use the URDF format for specifying all of our robot elements.
There is a long ongoing debate on wheather it is good to use the SDF or the URDF format for robot simulations!.
But since husky , turtlebot simulators use URDF file to specify robot elements , we are going to do the same.
&lt;strong&gt;Note apart for the URDF files that have the .xacro extension , you might see some file with .gazebo format which we will talk about later in this blog&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;More about URDF&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;URDF stands for The Unified Robotic Description Format (URDF). It is an XML file format used in ROS to describe all elements of a robot.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We will use xacro for writing our URDF files.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;What is xacro ??&lt;/em&gt;
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Xacro (XML Macros) Xacro is an XML macro language. With xacro, you can construct shorter and more readable XML files by using macros that expand to larger XML expressions.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now I will cover more about the different components of URDF files!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;urdf-basics&quot;&gt;URDF Basics:&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are certain elements in URDF for describing robot’s dynamics.
I am going to cover a few basic and essential elements.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;robot&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; element&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is the &lt;strong&gt;root element&lt;/strong&gt; in the program. 
All of the other elements describing robot will be encapsulated within this element.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;link&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; element&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The link element describes a &lt;strong&gt;rigid body&lt;/strong&gt; in the robot.
A rigid body in any simulation has 3 properties:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Inertial
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Here you can specify the mass of the link&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;You can specify the inertia values and they will be stored in a 3 * 3 rotational inertia matrix&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Let’s now see an example of the code&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;  &amp;lt;inertial&amp;gt;
         &amp;lt;origin xyz=&quot;0 0 0.5&quot; rpy=&quot;0 0 0&quot;/&amp;gt;
         &amp;lt;mass value=&quot;1&quot;/&amp;gt;
         &amp;lt;inertia ixx=&quot;100&quot;  ixy=&quot;0&quot;  ixz=&quot;0&quot; iyy=&quot;100&quot; iyz=&quot;0&quot; izz=&quot;100&quot; /&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;/inertial&amp;gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Visual Features&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Here you can specify how you rigid body will look&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Hence here you can specify geometry , like a box , a sphere etc.&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;You can also meshes to give a look to your rigid bodies and it will be specified here only&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Lets’ also see an example of this&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt; &amp;lt;visual&amp;gt;
      &amp;lt;origin xyz=&quot;0 0 0&quot; rpy=&quot;0 0 0&quot; /&amp;gt;
        &amp;lt;geometry&amp;gt;
          &amp;lt;box size=&quot;1 1 1&quot; /&amp;gt;
        &amp;lt;/geometry&amp;gt;
        &amp;lt;material name=&quot;Cyan&quot;&amp;gt;
          &amp;lt;color rgba=&quot;0 1.0 1.0 1.0&quot;/&amp;gt;
        &amp;lt;/material&amp;gt;
 &amp;lt;/visual&amp;gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Collision&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;As the name sounds , this element helps you to specify the collision properties of the rigid body&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;A colision element in a element will be converted into a 3D vector , in order to simplify the computations&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;You can also use multiple collision element for a rigid body&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Let’s see an example of this&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;collision&amp;gt;
       &amp;lt;origin xyz=&quot;0 0 0&quot; rpy=&quot;0 0 0&quot;/&amp;gt;
       &amp;lt;geometry&amp;gt;
        &amp;lt;cylinder radius=&quot;1&quot; length=&quot;0.5&quot;/&amp;gt;
       &amp;lt;/geometry&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;/collision&amp;gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;putting-it-together&quot;&gt;Putting it together&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So Uptill now , our code structure will look something like&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;We have a root robot element&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;In that we will have different rigid bodies specified by links&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Overall the follwing picture would be helpful to visualise the structure of a link&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://wiki.ros.org/urdf/XML/link?action=AttachFile&amp;amp;do=get&amp;amp;target=inertial.png&quot; alt=&quot;link_str&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Joint&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;This element describes the kinematics and the dynamic of the “joint”&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A joint in Gazebo is formed between parent link and the child link&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A joint can be made as follows in the URDF File&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;joint name=&quot;joint3&quot; type=&quot;continuous&quot;&amp;gt;
       &amp;lt;parent link=&quot;link3&quot;/&amp;gt;
       &amp;lt;child link=&quot;link4&quot;/&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/joint&amp;gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Following picture is good to visualize the point I am saying&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://wiki.ros.org/urdf/XML/joint?action=AttachFile&amp;amp;do=get&amp;amp;target=joint.png&quot; alt=&quot;joint_str&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Gazebo&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Whatever is written in this element , will not be parsed by xacro&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Instead it will direcly be used by gazebo&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;It is used to specify simulation properties such as color etc.&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Generally , these elements are store in the file with extension .gazebo that I told you about in the file structure module&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These elements are enough to get you started !
You will be able to now construct anything you want to make in Gazebo!
If you are anything like me , you will be probably asking , that these are just rigid bodies , but how to add functonalities to them?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then ans is &lt;strong&gt;Plugins!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Gazebo has several builtin Plugins to use&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;For example range plugin for the range sensor&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Diff drive plugin for the diff drive controller&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;You can declare them , by just mentioning the body , you want to add functionalities to.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Also remember to put them in a &lt;gazebo&gt; tag , as they are specific to gazebo and wont be parsed by xacro&lt;/gazebo&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;You can declare them like&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;gazebo&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;plugin name = &quot; &quot; filename = &quot; &quot;&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/plugin&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/gazebo&amp;gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now you can completely make your robot with sensor’s also!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Note:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;In order to launch this robot in gazebo just add robot description parameter in your launch file.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Like&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;  &amp;lt;param name=&quot;robot_description&quot; command=&quot;$(find xacro)/xacro.py '$(find fb_description)/urdf/fb.xacro'&quot;/&amp;gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As an example you can look at the simulation made by us here at Team ARES&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;It has a skid drive controller and We have added a realsense camera , IMU etc. sensors to it&lt;/li&gt;

  <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;It was a picture of a boa constrictor in the act of swallowing an animal. Here is a copy of the drawing:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://localhost:4000/images/money.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Drawing A&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the book it said: “Boa constrictors swallow their prey whole, without
chewing it. After that they are not able to move, and they sleep through the
six months that they need for digestion.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I pondered deeply, then, over the adventures of the jungle. And after some
work with a colored pencil I succeeded in making my ﬁrst drawing. 
My Drawing Number One. It looked like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://localhost:4000/images/sticker-mule.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Drawing Number One&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I showed my masterpiece to the grown-ups, and asked them whether the
drawing frightened them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But they answered: “Frighten? Why should any one be frightened by a
hat?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My drawing was not a picture of a hat. It was a picture of a boa constrictor
digesting an elephant. But since the grown-ups were not able to understand it,
I made another drawing: I drew the inside of the boa constrictor, so that the
grown-ups could see it clearly. They always need to have things explained.&lt;/p&gt;

  <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;“Whenever you feel like criticizing any one,” he told me, “just remember that all the people in this world haven’t had the advantages that you’ve had.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He didn’t say any more, but we’ve always been unusually communicative in a reserved way, and I understood that he meant a great deal more than that. In consequence, I’m inclined to reserve all judgments, a habit that has opened up many curious natures to me and also made me the victim of not a few veteran bores. The abnormal mind is quick to detect and attach itself to this quality when it appears in a normal person, and so it came about that in college I was unjustly accused of being a politician, because I was privy to the secret griefs of wild, unknown men. Most of the confidences were unsought — frequently I have feigned sleep, preoccupation, or a hostile levity when I realized by some unmistakable sign that an intimate revelation was quivering on the horizon; for the intimate revelations of young men, or at least the terms in which they express them, are usually plagiaristic and marred by obvious suppressions. Reserving judgments is a matter of infinite hope. I am still a little afraid of missing something if I forget that, as my father snobbishly suggested, and I snobbishly repeat, a sense of the fundamental decencies is parcelled out unequally at birth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And, after boasting this way of my tolerance, I come to the admission that it has a limit. Conduct may be founded on the hard rock or the wet marshes, but after a certain point I don’t care what it’s founded on. When I came back from the East last autumn I felt that I wanted the world to be in uniform and at a sort of moral attention forever; I wanted no more riotous excursions with privileged glimpses into the human heart. Only Gatsby, the man who gives his name to this book, was exempt from my reaction — Gatsby, who represented everything for which I have an unaffected scorn. If personality is an unbroken series of successful gestures, then there was something gorgeous about him, some heightened sensitivity to the promises of life, as if he were related to one of those intricate machines that register earthquakes ten thousand miles away. This responsiveness had nothing to do with that flabby impressionability which is dignified under the name of the “creative temperament.”— it was an extraordinary gift for hope, a romantic readiness such as I have never found in any other person and which it is not likely I shall ever find again. No — Gatsby turned out all right at the end; it is what preyed on Gatsby, what foul dust floated in the wake of his dreams that temporarily closed out my interest in the abortive sorrows and short-winded elations of men.
My family have been prominent, well-to-do people in this Middle Western city for three generations. The Carraways are something of a clan, and we have a tradition that we’re descended from the Dukes of Buccleuch, but the actual founder of my line was my grandfather’s brother, who came here in fifty-one, sent a substitute to the Civil War, and started the wholesale hardware business that my father carries on to-day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I never saw this great-uncle, but I’m supposed to look like him — with special reference to the rather hard-boiled painting that hangs in father’s office. I graduated from New Haven in 1915, just a quarter of a century after my father, and a little later I participated in that delayed Teutonic migration known as the Great War. I enjoyed the counter-raid so thoroughly that I came back restless. Instead of being the warm centre of the world, the Middle West now seemed like the ragged edge of the universe — so I decided to go East and learn the bond business. Everybody I knew was in the bond business, so I supposed it could support one more single man. All my aunts and uncles talked it over as if they were choosing a prep school for me, and finally said, “Why — ye — es,” with very grave, hesitant faces. Father agreed to finance me for a year, and after various delays I came East, permanently, I thought, in the spring of twenty-two.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The practical thing was to find rooms in the city, but it was a warm season, and I had just left a country of wide lawns and friendly trees, so when a young man at the office suggested that we take a house together in a commuting town, it sounded like a great idea. He found the house, a weather-beaten cardboard bungalow at eighty a month, but at the last minute the firm ordered him to Washington, and I went out to the country alone. I had a dog — at least I had him for a few days until he ran away — and an old Dodge and a Finnish woman, who made my bed and cooked breakfast and muttered Finnish wisdom to herself over the electric stove.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was lonely for a day or so until one morning some man, more recently arrived than I, stopped me on the road.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“How do you get to West Egg village?” he asked helplessly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I told him. And as I walked on I was lonely no longer. I was a guide, a pathfinder, an original settler. He had casually conferred on me the freedom of the neighborhood.
And so with the sunshine and the great bursts of leaves growing on the trees, just as things grow in fast movies, I had that familiar conviction that life was beginning over again with the summer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There was so much to read, for one thing, and so much fine health to be pulled down out of the young breath-giving air. I bought a dozen volumes on banking and credit and investment securities, and they stood on my shelf in red and gold like new money from the mint, promising to unfold the shining secrets that only Midas and Morgan and Maecenas knew. And I had the high intention of reading many other books besides. I was rather literary in college — one year I wrote a series of very solemn and obvious editorials for the “Yale News.”— and now I was going to bring back all such things into my life and become again that most limited of all specialists, the “well-rounded man.” This isn’t just an epigram — life is much more successfully looked at from a single window, after all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was a matter of chance that I should have rented a house in one of the strangest communities in North America. It was on that slender riotous island which extends itself due east of New York — and where there are, among other natural curiosities, two unusual formations of land. Twenty miles from the city a pair of enormous eggs, identical in contour and separated only by a courtesy bay, jut out into the most domesticated body of salt water in the Western hemisphere, the great wet barnyard of Long Island Sound. They are not perfect ovals — like the egg in the Columbus story, they are both crushed flat at the contact end — but their physical resemblance must be a source of perpetual confusion to the gulls that fly overhead. To the wingless a more arresting phenomenon is their dissimilarity in every particular except shape and size.
I lived at West Egg, the — well, the less fashionable of the two, though this is a most superficial tag to express the bizarre and not a little sinister contrast between them. My house was at the very tip of the egg, only fifty yards from the Sound, and squeezed between two huge places that rented for twelve or fifteen thousand a season. The one on my right was a colossal affair by any standard — it was a factual imitation of some Hotel de Ville in Normandy, with a tower on one side, spanking new under a thin beard of raw ivy, and a marble swimming pool, and more than forty acres of lawn and garden. It was Gatsby’s mansion. Or, rather, as I didn’t know Mr. Gatsby, it was a mansion inhabited by a gentleman of that name. My own house was an eyesore, but it was a small eyesore, and it had been overlooked, so I had a view of the water, a partial view of my neighbor’s lawn, and the consoling proximity of millionaires — all for eighty dollars a month.&lt;/p&gt;
